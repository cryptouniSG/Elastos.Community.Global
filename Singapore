# SG  &nbsp; Singapore

Hi Everyone,

I am Darren and I run an inter-unversity blockchain community in Singapore. We are a 800 strong student undergraduate community that are very active in the space.
My team and I are excited to build the Elastos community in Singapore and enhance the branding among seasoned developers who can quickly ramp up and develop future apps on Elastos or participate in Elastos upcoming hackathon/competition.

Feel free to reach out to me and I look forward to seeing you.

Thank you,

Darren
